# Numerical-Optimization-Full-Monte-Coding
In this project, I have try to build a code which can fluently work on the nonlinear numerical algorithms for the test functions.
The list of test functions can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization.
Algorithms used:
a)Steepest descent line search
b) Newton's Line Search
c)Trust Region
d)Conjugate Gradient
e)Quasi Newton
f)Inexact Newton
